Name of App: Adrift<br />

Adrift is an app targeted for sleep and relaxation. It is an audio and visual style app with minimal words, suitable for usage to aid in sleep or calming down. The app has a simple layout with minimal words so that users can navigate and follow through easily with visual and audio guides. This app will allow users to practice relaxation exercises like slow breathing and listen to calming music. It also contains a guide and exercises for users to do before they sleep. With Adrift, you will be immersed in peace and be able to drift into deep and restful sleep.<br />
<br />Background of app:
It is an app idea born out of the context of the increase in mental health issues among the community due to the current pandemic situation with the aim to reach out to those in need of help in these areas. Adrift targets one of the causes and effects of mental health issues which is a lack of restful sleep. This app targets at calming the mind whether in times of stress, worry or to fall asleep easily and also a guide to have restful sleep, which is important to have a clear mind and positive emotions.  <br />
</br>Design process: 
The thinking process behind the theme and design is to create an atmosphere suitable for relaxing the mind and also before sleep. I chose a simple layout with minimalistic style as I did not want the layout to look messy or cluttered with will make it difficult for users to navigate and to make it more pleasant and peaceful looking. Throughout the app, I tried to limit the number of words used as I did not want too much stimulation of the mind by needing to read through long paragraphs of words, which can be tedious before sleep or trying to calm down. I used visual ,audio guides and little words so that I can get my message across to users quickly and simply. 
<br />

<br />Navigation design of app:
The flow of navigation of the features in the app is from left to right. 
For users who want to use the app to relax, they can use the features on the “relax” page.
For users who want to use the app for sleep, they can make use of all features of the app. The flow would be “relax” page, ”sleep” page , then “go to sleep” feature on the “more “ page, following a left to right flow.
Within each page, I designed a top to bottom flow whereby features that I want user to do first is placed on top. 
In general the navigation structure is a left to right flow throughout the app and a top down flow within each main page in the app.
The whole navigation flow, events and features is based on the process to get a good night’s sleep.</br>
</br> Design process from draft to final layout:</br>

Technologies used:
-	Java: to program the activities and functions 
-	XML: to set the layout for each activity

Concepts used:

-	Multimedia-images, animations, audio
-	Recyclerview
-	Fragments
-	Shared preferences
-	alert dialogue
-	countdown timer

Testing:
I observed how some users used my app and made changes based on these observations
-	Testing of user input page:
Initially button to enter the app after user input name was placed at the bottom of the input text, but after observing how the user had to close the keyboard for the button to be visible , I changed the button to the right of the input text
-	Testing of “go to sleep feature”:
Observed whether user was able to understand the feature as I did not intend to put any instructions for that feature. Along the way I found a flaw that the alert dialogue closed when user clicked outside the alert message and went to fix it.
-	Testing of breathing exercise:
Found a flaw that caused the app to force shut down when user click breathing exercise and click back before the countdown timer reached 0. I went to fix and change the structure and flow of the code for that feature.
