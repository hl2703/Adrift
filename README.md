Adrift <br />
Name of App: Adrift <br />
Adrift is an app targeted for sleep and relaxation. It is an audio and visual style app with minimal words, suitable for usage to aid in sleep or calming down. The app has a simple layout with minimal words so that users can navigate and follow through easily with visual and audio guides. This app will allow users to practice relaxation exercises like slow breathing and listen to calming music. It also contains a guide and exercises for users to do before they sleep. With Adrift, you will be immersed in peace and be able to drift into deep and restful sleep.
Background of app:
It is an app idea born out of the context of the increase in mental health issues among the community due to the current pandemic situation with the aim to reach out to those in need of help in these areas. Adrift targets one of the causes and effects of mental health issues which is a lack of restful sleep. This app targets at calming the mind whether in times of stress, worry or to fall asleep easily and also a guide to have restful sleep, which is important to have a clear mind and positive emotions.  

Design process: 
The thinking process behind the theme and design is to create an atmosphere suitable for relaxing the mind and also before sleep. I chose a simple layout with minimalistic style as I did not want the layout to look messy or cluttered with will make it difficult for users to navigate and to make it more pleasant and peaceful looking. Throughout the app, I tried to limit the number of words used as I did not want too much stimulation of the mind by needing to read through long paragraphs of words, which can be tedious before sleep or trying to calm down. I used visual, audio guides and little words so that I can get my message across to users quickly and simply.
